This file contains general rules for how the SystemC code should be written in order for the
sysc2ver.py program to run correctly. One of the goals of this development is to eliminate
as many of these rules as possible.

Header file rules:
  No blank line after SC_Module and I/O list
  One blank line seperating I/O list and register list
  There must be at least one reg entry (add sc_uint<1> dummy; if none).
  } at end of constructor should be on line by itself
  edge for reset should be the same direction as for the clock
  expection at least one local variable, if not define sc_uint<1> dummy;

Method file rules:
  Method declaration ("void file::method()") should have { on next line
  only one mnuemonic constant per line
  no new variable defintions within method
  no logical = comparisons in clocked logic
  (0 ..) mapps to {3'b000 ..}
  if .range() is used in a compound boolean expression, put each expression on a seperate line.
